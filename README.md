# ChainLink Portfolio - Polkadot Cross-Chain Activity Tracker

> A user-centric Web3 application built for the [Build Resilient Apps with Polkadot Cloud](https://polkadot.devpost.com/) hackathon.

## 🎯 Project Vision

**ChainLink Portfolio** aggregates your Web3 identity and activity across multiple Polkadot parachains into a unified, beautiful dashboard. Own your data, visualize your cross-chain presence, and showcase your Web3 footprint.

### Why This Matters
In the Polkadot ecosystem, users interact with multiple parachains (Astar, Moonbeam, Acala, etc.), but each chain operates independently. This creates a **fragmented identity problem** - your complete Web3 presence is scattered across chains. ChainLink Portfolio solves this by leveraging Polkadot's cross-chain architecture to give users a complete view of their blockchain activity.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔗 **Multi-Chain Aggregation** - View assets across 3-4 Polkadot parachains in one place
- 💰 **Portfolio Dashboard** - Real-time balances, tokens, and activity tracking
- 📊 **Data Visualization** - Charts showing portfolio composition and activity
- 🔐 **Privacy-First** - Client-side aggregation, you control your data
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** - Beautiful interface on any device
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Web2-quality user experience in Web3

## 🏆 Hackathon Theme

**User-Centric Apps** - This project puts users first by:
- Giving users complete control over their data
- Solving a real problem (fragmented Web3 identity)
- Providing actual utility beyond speculation
- Making Polkadot ecosystem more accessible

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Polkadot.js API
- **Wallet**: Polkadot.js Extension
- **Visualization**: Recharts
- **Target Chains**: Polkadot Relay Chain, Astar, Moonbeam, Acala

## 📋 Project Structure (Spec-Kit)

This project uses [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for systematic development:

```
polkadot/
├── memory/              # Project memory and constitution
│   └── constitution.md  # Project principles and guidelines
├── specs/              # Feature specifications (to be created)
├── scripts/            # Helper scripts
├── templates/          # Spec-Kit templates
├── CLAUDE.md          # AI context file
└── README.md          # This file
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Polkadot.js browser extension
- Basic understanding of Web3 concepts

### Spec-Kit Workflow

This project follows the Spec-Kit development methodology:

#### 1. ✅ Constitution Created
The project constitution defines our principles, tech stack, and constraints.  
📄 See: `memory/constitution.md`

#### 2. ⏳ Next: Create Specification
Define the detailed features and user stories.  
Run: `/speckit.spec` command with your feature description

#### 3. ⏳ Generate Implementation Plan
Create a detailed implementation strategy.  
Run: `/speckit.plan` command

#### 4. ⏳ Break Down Tasks
Convert the plan into actionable tasks.  
Run: `/speckit.tasks` command

#### 5. ⏳ Implement
Build the application systematically.  
Run: `/speckit.implement` command

## 🎓 Learning Journey

This project is built by a developer **new to blockchain** but experienced in web/mobile development. The codebase includes:

- 📚 **Extensive comments** explaining blockchain concepts
- 🔗 **Links to documentation** for deeper learning
- 📖 **Progressive complexity** - start simple, add features incrementally
- 🎯 **Real-world examples** of Polkadot.js usage

## 📊 Development Phases

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Foundation - Wallet connection, single parachain
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Multi-chain integration and data aggregation
- **Phase 3 (Week 5)**: Visualization, UI/UX polish
- **Phase 4 (Week 6)**: Documentation, demo video, submission
