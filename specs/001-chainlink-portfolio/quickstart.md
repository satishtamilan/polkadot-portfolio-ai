   - Parallel task identification
   - Completion criteria for each task

## Project Overview

**ChainLink Portfolio** - Cross-Chain Asset & Activity Tracker for Polkadot

### What It Does
- Connects to Polkadot.js wallet
- Queries 4 parachains (Polkadot, Astar, Moonbeam, Acala)
- Aggregates balances and activity
- Displays unified dashboard with charts
- Shows portfolio value in USD
- Mobile-responsive, modern UI

### Why It's Great for the Hackathon
✅ **User-Centric** - Solves fragmented identity problem  
✅ **Polkadot Cloud** - Showcases cross-chain capabilities  
✅ **Real Utility** - Actual value for ecosystem users  
✅ **Professional** - High-quality code and design  
✅ **Educational** - Well-documented for learning  

## Tech Stack

```
Frontend:    Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Blockchain:  Polkadot.js API
Chains:      Polkadot, Astar, Moonbeam, Acala
Charts:      Recharts
Wallet:      Polkadot.js Extension
```

## Development Timeline

**6 Weeks Total (Until Nov 17, 2025)**

- **Week 1-2**: Phase 1 - Foundation & wallet connection
- **Week 3-4**: Phase 2 - Multi-chain integration
- **Week 5**: Phase 3 - Visualization & polish
- **Week 6**: Phase 4 - Documentation & submission

## Next Steps

### Ready to Start Implementation!

**Phase 1 - Foundation (16 hours)**

We'll build:
1. Next.js application with TypeScript
2. Wallet connection with Polkadot.js extension
3. Polkadot Relay Chain integration
4. Basic dashboard displaying DOT balance
5. Beautiful UI components

**First Tasks**:
- Task 1.1: Initialize Next.js app
- Task 1.2: Configure project structure
- Task 1.3: Create type definitions
- Task 1.4: Create utility functions
- Task 1.5: Create base UI components

### How to Proceed

**Option 1: Implement Phase 1 Now (Recommended)**
I can start building Phase 1 right now. Within a few hours, you'll have:
- Working Next.js app
- Wallet connection functioning
- First parachain (Polkadot) displaying balance
- Professional UI

**Option 2: Review Planning First**
Take time to review the planning documents and ask questions:
- Read through `spec.md` to understand features
- Check `plan.md` to see implementation strategy
- Review `tasks.md` to see the task breakdown

**Option 3: Customize Planning**
Make changes to the spec/plan/tasks before implementation:
- Add/remove features
- Adjust tech stack
- Modify timeline
- Change scope

## Learning Resources

As we build, you'll learn:
- **Blockchain Basics**: Wallets, addresses, transactions
- **Polkadot Architecture**: Relay chain, parachains, XCM
- **Polkadot.js API**: Connecting, querying, data handling
- **Web3 Patterns**: Wallet connections, RPC queries
- **React Best Practices**: Hooks, context, performance

Every file will have extensive comments explaining concepts!

## Questions?

Ask me anything about:
- The specification or plan
- How specific features work
- Blockchain concepts you don't understand
- Changes you want to make
- Implementation approaches

## Ready to Build?

Say **"Start Phase 1"** and I'll begin implementing the foundation! 🚀

Or ask questions about the planning first. Either way, you're set up for success!
