# Claude Context: ChainLink Portfolio

## Current Project State
**Status**: Initial Setup  
**Phase**: Constitution Created  
**Next Step**: Create Feature Specification using `/speckit.spec`

## Project Summary
Building a cross-chain asset and activity tracker for the Polkadot Cloud hackathon. This project demonstrates Polkadot's multi-chain capabilities by aggregating user data across multiple parachains into a unified dashboard.

## Developer Context
- **Experience Level**: Experienced web/mobile developer, new to blockchain
- **Learning Goal**: Understand blockchain fundamentals while building
- **Target**: Polkadot Cloud Hackathon (Deadline: Nov 17, 2025)
- **Theme**: User-Centric Apps

## Key Project Constraints
1. Must use Polkadot Cloud ecosystem
2. Must demonstrate cross-chain capabilities
3. Code must be educational (extensive comments)
4. Professional quality for hackathon judges
5. 6 weeks development timeline

## Tech Stack Decisions
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Polkadot.js API
- **Target Chains**: Polkadot, Astar, Moonbeam, Acala
- **Wallet**: Polkadot.js Extension

## Constitution Location
See `memory/constitution.md` for complete project principles, constraints, and guidelines.

## Development Approach
Using Spec-Kit workflow:
1. ✅ Constitution defined
2. ⏳ Create specification (next)
3. ⏳ Generate implementation plan
4. ⏳ Break down into tasks
5. ⏳ Implement systematically

## Important Reminders
- This is a learning project - explain concepts in code comments
- Balance learning with execution
- Keep user-centric principles at the forefront
- Document everything for hackathon submission
- Real-world utility is key for judges
